Qizone: Music curation Spotify Apps Boilerplate
===============

This is a boilerplate app that contains the minimum required code to create
a Spotify app. It also contains a few simple examples of how to use some of
our APIs.

This is an extension to the boilerplate aimed as a starting point for people who are willing to make their own music curation service like Tunigo (nowmore Browse) or Digster!

To test the application your Spotify account needs to have the developer flag
set. You can find out how to activate the developer flag [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account).

Clone this repository in your Spotify workspace directory. If you haven't got a Spotify directory, read about where to create it [here](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/#creatinganapp). Cloning will create a subfolder called boilerplate-app. 

You can access the application (restart the Spotify desktop client if you have not done so) by typing in spotify:app:boilerplate-app in the search field.
Read more about this in the [Spotify Developer Guidelines](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/).

to support all languages available.

**[index.html](https://github.com/spotify/boilerplate-app/blob/master/index.html)** loads the **[scripts/main.js]((https://github.com/spotify/boilerplate-app/blob/master/scripts/main.js)** file, our entry point to develop applications. In turn, main.js loads  four script files, each showcasing a part of the Spotify Apps API.
